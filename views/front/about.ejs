  <h5>Recording and transmission of film</h5>
  <br />
  <p>
    The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with
    a motion-picture camera, by photographing drawings or miniature models using
    traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer animation, or
    by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual
    effects
  </p>
  <p>
    Before the introduction of digital production, series of still images were
    recorded on a strip of chemically sensitized celluloid (photographic film
    stock), usually at the rate of 24 frames per second. The images are
    transmitted through a movie projector at the same rate as they were
    recorded, with a Geneva drive ensuring that each frame remains still during
    its short projection time. A rotating shutter causes stroboscopic intervals
    of darkness, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions due to flicker
    fusion. The apparent motion on the screen is the result of the fact that the
    visual sense cannot discern the individual images at high speeds, so the
    impressions of the images blend with the dark intervals and are thus linked
    together to produce the illusion of one moving image. An analogous optical
    soundtrack (a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds)
    runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and was not
    projected.

    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
    1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
    make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
    the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It
    was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
    like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
